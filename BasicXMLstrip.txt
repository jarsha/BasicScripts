Using Etree since im not sure if they will have C libraries locally.

from xml.etree import Element as X

"""XML information, verions, etc etc etc
<info>
	<info sub tree>
		<Whatimlookingfor>12345</Whatimlookingfor>
	</info sub tree>
</info>
""".strip()
Information = X.fromstring(xml).find('info/infosub/Whatimlookingfor')


It will find the value 12345 and put it into a file named Information. For each new script i need to make, i would just have it append the information as a new line into the Information file.
